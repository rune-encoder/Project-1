## **Project Overview**

This project explores the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EV) across the United States with a special focus on key states such as California, Texas, and Florida. We use data analysis and modeling to track EV adoption trends, correlate them with demographic factors (like population and income), and evaluate the availability of infrastructure (charging stations). The goal is to provide insights into the current state of EV adoption and forecast future trends.

## **Dataset Information**

The datasets used for this project are drawn from multiple sources, covering:

EV Registrations: Yearly vehicle registration data at both state and national levels.
Charging Stations: Data on the installation of charging stations by state.
Demographic Data: Population density and median income at the zip code and county levels for all 50 states, with specific deep dives into Florida, Texas, and California.
Historical Data: Year-over-year changes in EV and gasoline vehicle registrations to track trends.

## **Analysis Approach**

The analysis consists of two main parts:

National Overview (All 50 States):
Yearly EV registration data for all 50 states.
Correlation analysis between population density, income levels, and EV adoption.
Evaluation of charging infrastructure by state and its impact on adoption rates.

State-Specific Deep Dive (Florida, Texas, California):
Detailed examination of EV adoption at the zip code and county levels.
Comparison of EV registrations and charging infrastructure growth within these key states.
Analysis of state-led incentives and their correlation with adoption trends.


## **Visualizations and Findings**
The analysis includes a series of visualizations to highlight key findings:

National EV Growth Trends: Line charts showing EV adoption across all 50 states over time.
State Comparisons: Bar charts comparing EV registrations and charging stations per capita across key states.
Correlation Heatmaps: Visualizations of the correlation between income, population, and EV adoption.
State-Specific Maps: Geographic visualizations of EV adoption and infrastructure distribution within Florida, Texas, and California.

## **Conclusion and Implications**

Our analysis reveals that:

National Trends: EV adoption is steadily increasing across the U.S., driven by higher-income states and better-developed infrastructure.
State-Level Trends: California leads in EV adoption, with Texas and Florida showing rapid growth due to increased state incentives.
Key Drivers: Income levels, population density, and charging infrastructure availability are key factors influencing EV adoption.
Future Market: States investing in infrastructure and offering strong incentives will see accelerated growth in EV adoption over the next decade.

## **Future Work**
Expand for evaluation and deep dive of 20 key states
Include Gender/Ethnic distribution factors
Expand to compare with workd trends
